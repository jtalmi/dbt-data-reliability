  - name: column_changes
    description: >
      Comparison of the current and previous columns of tables, that returns detailed changes.
      The monitored changes are new columns, removed columns and data type changes.
      Note that renaming of a column will create two changes - column added (new name) and column removed (old name).
      The table is incremental, with 'change_id' as a unique key.
    columns:
      - name: change_id
        description: "Unique id of the change, generated using: 'full_table_name', 'column_name', 'change', 'detected_at'."
